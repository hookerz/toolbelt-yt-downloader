<p>This utility will wrap retina sizes jpgs and pngs in html5 wrappers so those units will look right as ads on retina
  screens. The units are wrapped in DCM HTML5.</p>
<h2>How To Use</h2>
<p>Use the form below to tell the application which directory you want to wrap. That application expects that directory to have 2 folders in it: <em>/Retina</em> and <em>/Statics</em>. the Retina should be at 2X screen resolution and the static should be at 1X. Both need to have exactly the same file name. You can have as many levels of folders inside those 2 folders as you need. The finalized files wlll be placed in <em>/Output</em> in the same folder.</p>
